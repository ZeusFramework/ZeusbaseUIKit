SimpleCocoaApp
==============

SimpleCocoaApp is a small application that is meant to show some of the basic things you can do with Objective-C and Cocoa. This application displays different "Hello Cocoa" dialogs to the user based upon radio-button and PopUp menu selections. The user can change which hello message is sent by selecting a different radio button. The user can change which Hello object receives the message by changing the PopUp menu selection. The dynamic nature of the Objective-C runtime and the power of Cocoa help make this "on-the-fly" code-path execution possible and the GUI easy to program.


Sample Requirements
The supplied Xcode project was created using Xcode v4.3 or later running under Mac OS X 10.7.x or later.


About the Sample
There are three classes in this application:
• Hello1: Contains implementations of message1, message2, and message3
• Hello2: Contains different implementations of message1, message2, and message3
• HelloController: Handles the data interaction between the GUI and the Hello objects, as well as displaying the ReadMe help file in response to a "SimpleCocoaApp Help" selection from the Help menu
