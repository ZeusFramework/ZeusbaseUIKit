Abstract: This class is responsible for two major activities. It sets up the images in the popup menu (via a custom view) and responds to the menu actions. Also, it supplies the suggestions for the search text field and responds to suggestion selection changes and text field editing.

    In MainMenu.xib, the menu for the popup button is defined. There is one menu item with a tag of 1000 that is used as the prototype for the custom menu items. Each ImagePickerMenuItemView can contain 4 images. So we keep duplicating the prototype menu item until we have enough menu items for each image found in the directory specified by _baseURL. Duplicating the prototype menu allows us to reuse the target action wiring done in IB.
